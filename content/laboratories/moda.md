The **CNR-SPIN Research Unit of Naples and Salerno** together with the **Physics Department of the University of Naples** have a considerable set of scientific equipment covering the following areas: advanced thin films deposition, micro- and nano-patterning, structural/morphological and electronic transport characterization down to ultra-low temperatures in the presence of high magnetic fields or external radiation, advanced optical characterization and spectroscopy in the wavelength range 200 – 1500 nm also time resolved, low noise electronic characterization of devices.

The core of the activity of the project dedicated to membranes fabrication is based on **MODA** (*Modular Facility for Oxide Deposition and Analysis*), a cluster system composed by a UHV Pulsed Laser Deposition system equipped with RHEED, and a UHV Multi-chambers Sputtering system, in-situ connected with X-Ray and Ultra-violet Photoemission Spectroscopy, Spot-Profile Analysis Low Energy Electron Diffraction (SPA-LEED) system and Scanning Probe Microscopy/Spectroscopy.
