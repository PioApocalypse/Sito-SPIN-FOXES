**FOXES** project aims at assessing a reliable technology for the creation and control of freestanding oxide heterostructures of different types with an innovative method, recently developed at CNR-SPIN labs of Naples Unit, relying on strain engineering during pulsed laser deposition (PLD) of LaAlO3 (LAO) on SrTiO3 (STO) substrate. By inducing an abrupt strain-relaxation process, that results in vertical cracks formation and substrate spalling, this method gives rise to the formation of regularly shaped epitaxial superconducting freestanding LAO/STO micro-membranes (mMs). Moreover, the epitaxy of in-plane-lattice mismatched oxides results in intrinsically curved membranes, hosting a strain-gradient several order of magnitude larger than what achievable in mechanical bended mm samples.

FOXES project aims to investigate in detail this process in order to:

\- Achieve a complete control of the thickness and size of the fabricated LAO/STO mMs; \
\- Fabricate and characterize more complex LAO/STO mMs with intercalated layers of other compounds; \
\- Apply the strain engineering method also to Sr- or Ca-ruthenate substrates; \
\- Investigate the effect of static strain and strain gradient on the mMs electronic properties. \
\- Implement membranes in nano-fabricated devices; \
\- Disseminate the results and gather together a community of national and international researchers working on freestanding membranes.
