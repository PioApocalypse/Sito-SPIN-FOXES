## Abstract
The ability to form freestanding oxide membranes of nanoscale thickness is of great interest for enabling material functionality and for integrating oxides in flexible electronic and photonic technologies. Recently, a route has been demonstrated for forming conducting heterostructure membranes of LaAlO<sub>3</sub> and SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, the canonical system for oxide electronics. In this route, the epitaxial growth of LaAlO<sub>3</sub> on SrTiO<sub>3</sub> resulted in a strained state that relaxed by producing freestanding membranes with random sizes and locations. Here, we extend the method to enable self-formed LaAlO<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> micromembranes with control over membrane position, their lateral sizes from 2 to 20 Î¼m, and with controlled transfer to other substrates of choice. This method opens up the possibility to study and use the two-dimensional electron gas in LaAlO<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> membranes for advanced device concepts.
