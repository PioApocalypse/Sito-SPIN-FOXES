For years, itinerant charge carriers in ferroelectric insulators were believed to completely quench ferroelectricity. Recent breakthroughs,
however, demonstrated the existence of a novel class of quasi-two-dimensional polar metals with promising applications in nonvolatile electronics and spintronics. Here, by combining temperature-dependent magnetotransport measurements, optical second harmonic generation (SHG), resonant photoemission spectroscopy (ResPES), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we report on the properties of a BaTiO<sub>3</sub>-based oxide heterostructure, sustaining a persistent polar displacement in the BaTiO<sub>3</sub> layer while supporting a two-dimensional electron gas. This suggests that the oxide heterostructure may operate as a polar metal system, paving the way for new developments in oxide-based electronics.
